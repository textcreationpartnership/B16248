            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is not the first time since my departur that I haue writ vnto you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall it bee the last. Nature will find a way to vent her duty were shee neuer so hard opprest. Out of sight is not out of mind, for were you but as mindefull of your selfe, as I am of you, I doubt not but by the effects you should find mee a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull sonne. But as the blind who see not themselues, thinke all other not to see them likewise, so you forgetting your self thinke mee forgetfull of you to‚ñ™ God knowes before whom one daye I am to giue an account of my duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, how that there passeth not a day, or night either, when you and yours take your rest, wherein there is not intercession made for you. If I knew what els in this my state a childs naturall obligation could effect, in the behalf of a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ther, I would with what indeauour I could accomplish it. But alas Deare Mother, when your request is vnreasonable, nay vnnaturall, as the forsaking my religi≈ç, Gods Church, his truth, nay himselfe, it standes not with the duty of a sonne any waye to yeald in the least to so vniust demaunds of a Mother. O that your desires weare but of that nature (of that good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee reade of in the Maccabees was,) who did encourage her children to suffer euen to death, for God. I doubt not but God would so strengthen me with his grace, that you should find my duty as ready to obey, as your pietie would bee willing to command. Though it bee not common for a sonne to teach his mother, but rather to follow hir in what shee should direct him, yet when parents mislead from the way of truth, shall without knowledge, command what is contrary to Gods will, and their childrens conscience, It may bee, nay it is the part of a dutyfull sonne, to remember that their command is amisse‚ñ™ &amp; cannot bee followed. All I heare now doe is no more; I doe but informe you that the happines you wish mee is not true &amp; reall happines. That not l≈çger I now, but your owne soule might bee the obiect of your thoughts. That you would from henceforth no longer bee astraynger from the truth. But submit your self to her, who as a louing Mother would receaue &amp; imbrace you, with all affection within the armes of veritie; first bee instructed by her, Deare Mother, and then shall you learne to gouerne &amp; guide your owne children in thinges that are good. And then I am sure they will bee ruled and guided by you. And this is all, should I doe leasse, I should thinke with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle that I were farre worse then an Infidell. For how can I behould wolues which pray not for you, but prey vpon you, and hould my tongue. Where were my dutie? I perceauing you tost vp and downe in the waues of herricie, as you are, &amp; your self ready to suffer shipwrack, and I not so much as offerring you my hand to draw you into the Arke. Which of all those blind guides that now peruert your poore soule dare or will affirme, that the foundation one which your saluation purchassed so dearely by the blood of your Sauiour, your faith is built, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallable. If fallable why doe you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard your saluation purchassed so dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely by the blood of your Sauiour vpon sand.

               </gap> desire you consider your owne declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge age, your life to come, your last iudgment, (&amp; if you doe not now heere in time) woorke a preuention of that fearefull sentƒìce which otherwise must passe vpon you, (that so you may avoide the wrath to come) endeauour somwhat to examine whether all bee true your false prophets preach vnto you, or at least whether they practise
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176697:3"/> what they preach. First try &amp; then trust. And because your capacitie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not master a better argument then to examine the liues of your professers of your owne sect, There begin. See first whether your new vpstart mynisters doe not like stage plaiers trickt vp in their neat apparell onely, and barely ackt, and talke, and practise nothing; they will tell you of Christs passion his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, his want, his hunger &amp; thirst, his humilitie, his patience, his labor &amp; trauell, his ignominy in being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, scourged, spitt one, in bearing his crosse: they will also tell, you of the Apostles pouertie, their sufferings, their wrongs and afflictions, but who is hee either of your Ministry, or Layetie, will follow your Sauiour in these his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, who is there among you that in your selues allow either of fasting, or watching, or voluntary pouertie, or good woorks, or afflicting your selues for Gods sake. To be despised to forsake the world, &amp; to liue for euer austerely in pennance for sinnes; they can commend these things in Christ &amp; his Apostles, &amp; yet forbid to bee practised by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. They will tell you that our Sauiour payd the price for vs, whereby wee are become heiers of God, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heiers with Christ, &amp; being heiers wee shall inherit, though wee suffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For Christ both suffered and satisfied for vs; but they will not see what followeth. For where the Apostle calleth vs heiers of God &amp;c. hee addeth imediately, if yee suffer to gether with him, signifiing that wee are heiers with Christ, vpon condition that wee suffer with him, to the end wee may bee glorified with him; for wee are not freed by our Sauiours passion from suffering, but the more inuited or rather obligued thereunto, witnesse our Sauiour himselfe, hee that will come after mee, let him deney him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and take vp his crosse and follow mee; But contrary if you will but looke into Gods Church, you shall not onely find Christ spoken of; but truely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. You shall see those, whose onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oy is in afflictions for Christs sake, whose song is that of the Apostle, God forbid I should reioyce in any thing, but in the crosse of Christ. Who haue forsaken all and giuen their whole Estate to maineteine the poore, and so committed themselues to the prouidence of God; wee haue not those who barely commend virtues in our Sauiour, but follow them in deed; also they are such that talke little, fast hard, pray much, suffer continually, they are in want &amp; that willingly, to helpe others. Poore they are in meanes, but poorer in spirit; and theirs onely is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. I will add no more least I should seeme rather to preach you a sermon, then to wright you a Letter. Deare Mother see &amp; bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with those who both of this faith &amp; life liues amongst you, I am sure their good wayes, will better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you in this kinde then my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And that you may bee the surer satisfied, let the trauels of any of my bretheren make triall, &amp; let them not doubt; But that they may bee as safe and as well for their calling, &amp; trauell here, as in England. I liue in Doway a halfe weeks iorny from you, trust my brotherly loue towards them for their safetie, at one of the English hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in Doway you shall find mee; I could rather wish to see any of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren heere at Doway, but I pray you if you will not take so hard a iorny for my sake, at least let mee heare from you. Direct your Letters to one M.

What if the whole Church visible be, (as for ought I know it is) in a Sardin condition; not onely weake and sicke, but euen ready to die. Yet may there be many names which haue not defiled their garments &amp; so there are.

The spirit quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; the flesh profiteth nothing. These are they who goe alwayes bound in the Spirit, not knowing what things will beefall them, but they passe not, neither is their life deare vnto them. For they are ready not to bee bound onely, but also to suffer for the name of the Lord Iesus. Nothing can bee too deare for him; who hath done so much for them. And yet (obserue me my Child) before they will goe into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> face of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they will haue as sure a warrant as Iacob had to meete his brother Esau.

The Saints will neuer thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into the mouth of the Beast, they haue more wisedom then so, but when the Harlot will play the Beare, and the Lion, with them, as many times shee doth, she is forced in spite of all hir mallice, to yeld them honey, &amp; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues so sweet, that they shall take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in infirmitie, in reproaches, in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, in persecutions, in distresses,<note place="margin">2.

What pleasant fruit shall grow from a bitter roote when the Lord hath watered it, or hath changed his nature? Tribulation shall worke patience; patience experience; experience hope; &amp; hope maketh not ashamed, see what kisses are here; I shall be more particular, anon. I haue to doe with a child, a child not in years but vnderstanding, the Harlot will keepe thee so; the Lord shew thee hir deceit, I goe on in the Generall. That both life and goods &amp; liberty are to be kept, yea &amp; to bee improued too, till they stand in competition, with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Gospel, &amp; now that they doe wee haue our warrant what to do, &amp; our woe too if wee doe it not; and to the Saints the choice is easy, neither are their liues now deare vnto them, it is now necessary, say they (the loue of Christ constrains them, that wee goe, not that we should liue. O! (my Son) how faine would I haue thee rightly vnderstand this? why know my child‚ñ™ these doe not thrust themselues into dƒÅger, as they will not cowardly auoid it. They dare not pray for persecution, against it they may; that they may not be hurt of it they do; nay in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, they wrestle with God, for they know that this Esau hath a stearne looke; &amp; there must be much adoe to gett kisses from him. Aske thy selfe (Child?) whether a good son, doth not quake to see the rode in his fathers hand, though perhaps but to beat a seruant.
